# The Math Curriculum I Wish I Had

*Overall reference:* Evan Chen's Napkin

*Precalculus*

- AoPS Precalc
- Gelfand Algebra, Trigonometry?

*Calculus*

- Calc I-II: Spivak - *Calculus*
- Calc III: Hubbard + Hubbard: *Differential Forms*
- Calc IV: ? I'm not sure of a good textbook for intro ODEs

*Linear Algebra*

- Non-rigorous/computational: Strang 
- Rigorous: Axler

*Real Analysis:*

- Abbott 
- Maybe Rudin? Pugh? Honestly Tao looks good

*Abstract Algebra:*

- Aluffi - *Notes from the Underground*
- Maybe *Chapter 0* too?
- Artin and D/F good too

*Differential Geometry*:

- curves and surfaces: Tapp
- manifolds: Lee *Smooth Manifolds*

*Topology*

- point-set: Munkres, maybe those Toronto notes, Tai-Danae Bradley's textbook?
- algebraic: Lee *Topological Manifolds*? 
- differential: Milnor fantastic and Guillemin/Polla

*Probability Theory*

- the Harvard Stat 101 book?
- uhhhhh insert measure theory here

*Complex Analysis*

- Stein + Shakarchi
- Bak + Newman
- Zakeri is honestly rlly good so maybe that

*Measure Theory*

- Stein + Shakachi
- idk maybe Folland

*Assorted books*

- *Abel's Theorem in Problems and Solutions* by V. I. Arnold
- *Primes of the Form $x^2+ny^2$*
-  *Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces for Undergraduates (The Theory of the Donut)*
