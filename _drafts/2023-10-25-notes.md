Went to Georgia Tech today for a [seminar](https://math-rtg-agant.franklinresearch.uga.edu/joint-athens-atlanta-number-theory-seminar)! Their [new student center](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/georgia-tech-john-lewis-student-center/85-a46611e0-84c6-4523-bb6c-5885c4fafce3) is very nice. Not only did I have a good dinner, I got to meet some cool people!

I've been thinking it's a good idea to write down some stuff that I've been thinking about out loud, so I can remember the things I've learned. I'm currently looking over the [Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) and some [algebraic number theory notes referenced there](https://feog.github.io/ANT10.pdf), which have been super helpful. Evan Chen really has a nice way of casually expositing which I find very insightful. These aren't some crazy things, but I still think they're worth writing about. 

In Dino's class today, we talked about sections. 

The sum of radical ideals is not always radical. For instance, take $I=(y)$ and $J=(y-x^2)$. Note that $x^2=y-(y-x^2)$, so $x^2\in I+J$. This means $x\in\sqrt{I+J}$, but $x$ is for sure not in $I+J$. Hence $I+J$ isn't radical. 

As said [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1701240/radical-ideals-in-mathbb-zx-such-that-their-sum-is-not-radical), the idea is to add strategically to get to a perfect power, which will get us strict inclusions on the radical of the sum. 

Also, I feel stupid, but I just realized that $\text{radical ideals}\supset\text{prime ideals}\supset\text{maximal ideals}$. The first inclusion I learned recently in commutative algebra, but I failed to make the connection to Nullstellensatz - of course prime ideals are radical! This way, the NSS correspondence works really nicely. Indeed, the corresponding inclusions in terms of varieties are $\text{affine varieties}\subset\text{irreducible varieties}\subset\text{single points}$. The last maximal ideals <-> single points is precisely NSS. Not sure if this is the case only in $\C[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ --- should be for all polynomial rings of algebraically closed fields? 

Also understood the motivation behind defining algebraic integers the way they are - as roots of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. (Let's just stick with number fields for now.) Something something Gauss' Lemma

The key is that we want $\mathcal{O}_K$ to be a ring. Actually, I just looked up some random image from a textbook (Swinnerton-Dyer), and he said this:

I'm not sure about the other requirements, but it's good for $\mathcal{O}_K$ to be a ring that has nice structure (i.e. a f.g. $\Z$-mod). And this only happens iff algebraic integers are defined the way they are.
