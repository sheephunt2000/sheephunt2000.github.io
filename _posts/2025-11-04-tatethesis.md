This post documents an interesting tidbit that I discovered back in June of this year while doing some reading meant for my summer work. (Specifically, my Discord logs seem to say June 10th, when I shared my findings with other UGA grad students.) I never shared this information here, mostly because I completely forgot this blog existed, but I'd like to write up because I find it interesting and I don't think this is broadly known. 

My summer reading was meant to be on Ramakrishan and Valenza's book [Fourier Analysis on Number Fields](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-3085-2), a friendly summary of the preliminary results needed to understand [Tate's thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate%27s_thesis). I was surprised to learn that "algebraic" number theory has a ton of analysis involved; the underlying Fourier analytic tools are so useful that they provide a very powerful reformulation of Hecke's earlier results on [Hecke L-functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_character). In particular, the [adele ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_ring) attached to a global field contains a ton of arithmetic information; as a locally compact abelian (LCA) group, it also carries over the Fourier analytic techniques developed in harmonic analysis to get us cool results. I wish I could say more, but unfortunately I understand too little. Maybe one day I will be able to understand [Matt Emerton's Stack Exchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/25125/1048464) on the matter...

At any rate, in an effort to understand all of this wonderful nonsense, I was reading Bjorn Poonen's [very nice notes](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/786/notes.pdf). I only made it to the top of page 2 before something caught my eye. 

> Hecke in 1918–1920 generalized Theorem 1.1 to Dedekind zeta functions $\zeta_K(s)$, and then quickly realized that his method applied also to Dirichlet $L$-functions and even more general $L$-functions. Tate in his 1950 Ph.D. thesis (reprinted in [Tat67]), **building on the 1946 Ph.D.**
> **thesis of Margaret Matchett (both of them were students of Emil Artin)**, gave an adelic variant of Hecke’s proof. (bolding mine)

I found this interesting. I'd done enough reading at this point to recognize names of mathematicians, but I hadn't previously heard of Margaret Matchett. This struck me as even more extraordinary given (an educated guess from the name) that this was a female mathematician doing number theory in 1946?! I had to learn more. And there was something interesting about that name Matchett; it was ringing a bell...

I googled Margaret Matchett and clicked on [the very first result](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=22886).

So indeed she was a student of Artin. Interestingly enough, she had no students, which I supposed made sense. If she had students, presumably her name would've been "out there" more than it already was. (I also didn't know that Artin had spent time in Bloomington, which must've been quite the jump from Zürich!) Even more intrigued, I decided to look farther. Perhaps it was worth investigating Tate's words himself. 

Consulting my copy of Cassels and Fröhlich (courtesy of [Commonwealth Books](https://commonwealthbooks.blackwidowpress.com/)),  whose last chapter is a full copy of Tate's thesis, Tate himself does mention Matchett in his historical introduction (and where I assume Poonen got his citation from). In a brief summary, he describes a program started by Hecke with his $\zeta$-functions, and continued by Chevalley, who introduced the idea of the idèle group in 1940. (A work, as an amused Tate remarks, whose "main purpose was to take analysis *out* of class field theory.") Artin and Whaples, in 1945, then defined valuation vectors and derived "from simple axioms all of the basic statments of algebraic number theory." 

So it makes sense that, around the same time, Artin would suggest to Matchett  to try to expand Hecke's original results using this new idèlic language! As Tate explains, 

> Matchett, a student of Artin’s, made a first attempt (1946) to continue this program and do analytic number theory by means of idèles and vectors. She succeeded in redefining the classical $\zeta$-functions in terms of integrals over the idèle group, and in interpreting the characters of Hecke as exactly those characters of the ideal group which can be derived from idèle characters. But in proving the functional equation she followed Hecke.
>
> Artin suggested to me the possibility of generalizing the notion of $\zeta$-function, and simplifying the proof of the analytic continuation and functional equation for it, by making fuller use of analysis in the spaces of valuation vectors and idèles themselves than Matchett had done. This thesis is the result of my work on his suggestion. 

So it seemed that Matchett's contributions were an important part of the story; providing the foundations for Tate's full realization of Artin's idèle-ized dream. 

The next few links were some LinkedIn profiles (probably not useful for someone who was PhD age in 1946...) but then I found a link to Chapter IV of a book entitled [Emil Artin and Beyond - Class Field Theory and $L$-functions](https://ems.press/books/hem/209/contents). This chapter, entitled "Margaret Matchett: Artin's student at Indiana and her thesis," contained fascinating information, both historical and mathematical. Indeed, the epigraph of the chapter contained part of Tate's earlier quote above.
